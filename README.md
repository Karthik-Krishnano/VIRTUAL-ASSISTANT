ABSTRACT

Virtual Assistants are very common in today’s world. It is basically an application program that can replace a human assistant in performing basic tasks.These assistants help the visually impaired a lot but there are rarely any of these for deaf people. The project focuses on providing a platform for the deaf people to communicate with the computer using sign languages and get their work
done. This can also help ordinary people to interact with these disabled people better than before. The project is an implementation of a voice+text+hand gesture based assistant which can play songs, movies, search the web , gives quick responses to the user’s questions and a lot more like other voice assistant.

INTRODUCTION

Virtual assistants are a member of every house and office. The tasks which are historically done by personal assistants are now replaced by virtual assistants. The modern technology allows even middle class or lower class people to have a virtual assistant in their pocket. The virtual assistant systems like the google assistant or Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft Cortana are now available in one’s fingertips. They are available 24/7 to listen to the users commands and perform the tasks for them.

Most of the assistants available are voice based. This turns out to be a very good 10 aid for the visually impaired people who finds it difficult to use digital keyboards. Till date there aren’t any good application software for the deaf people. They
can see but cannot hear or talk. They communicate with each other using sign languages which uses their hand most of the time.

A personal assistant that can take the user’s real time video as input, recognise the sign language and acts according to the user’s need will be a very novel idea and also it will be a great achievement to bring up the deaf people in the society. Along with the hand gesture input, audio and text inputs are also available for the user’s convenience.

Similar to other famous virtual assistants, this will also have a wake word or 20 wake sign to run the program. The assistant will be on sleep mode for rest of the time which assures the privacy of the user.
